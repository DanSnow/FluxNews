# Privacy Policy

Flux News doesn't collect any private information of any kind. The app doesn't perform any
tracking of the device and doesn't send any information to any third-party service. No ads, no
tracking, no 'anonymous bug report'. Nothing.

In order to work, Flux News requires the URL and the API key of your Miniflux server. This
information is stored locally encrypted and is solely used to connect to your own server. This information
is never sent or backed up to any third-party service.

Flux News is a free and open-source app made on my free time. I'm not interested in your private
information at all.
